# Contributing

Thanks for helping. Newcomers are welcome: you don't need to be an expert, and no question is too small.

## Find something to work on

- Issues labelled [good first issue](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are small and well described. [help wanted](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) issues need more context but are ready for anyone.
- Comment on the issue to say you're working on it, so no one else starts the same thing. If you stop, say so.
- For anything bigger than a small fix, open an issue first and agree on the approach.

## Set up

<!-- The exact commands: what to install (with versions), how to get the dependencies, how to run the project. -->

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/NAME
cd NAME
# install the dependencies
# run the project
```

## Run the tests

```bash
# the command CI runs, so a pull request passes there too
```

## Send a pull request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from the default branch.
2. Make one change per pull request, with a test when you change behaviour.
3. Run the tests and the linter.
4. Open the pull request, say what it changes and why, and link the issue (`Closes #12`).
5. Give it a title in the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) form, `type: what it does`:

   | Title | When |
   |---|---|
   | `fix: wrong code for Adrar` | A bug fix |
   | `feat: add postal codes` | A new feature |
   | `feat!: rename the code field` | A change that could break someone who uses the project |
   | `docs: explain the setup` | Documentation only; also `test:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `build:`, `style:`, `perf:` |

   A scope in brackets is optional: `fix(api): …`. A check fails until the title fits, and you can edit the title at any time.

Pull requests are squash-merged, so the title becomes the commit's message, and the changelog and the next version are made from it: don't edit `CHANGELOG.md` yourself.

## Review

- A maintainer reviews every pull request; we may ask for changes, which is normal.
- **CI on a pull request from a fork waits until a maintainer approves the run.** That's a safety setting, not a judgement on your change.
- Answer review comments with new commits rather than a force-push, so the conversation stays readable. The squash merge tidies the history.
- A maintainer merges once CI passes and every conversation is resolved.
- Nothing is closed automatically. If a pull request goes quiet for a long time, we ask before we close it.

## AI-assisted contributions

You're welcome to use AI coding tools, on these terms:

- **You are the author.** Understand every line you submit, and be ready to explain it in review. "The model wrote it" doesn't answer a review comment.
- **Say so.** Tick the AI box in the pull request template, and name the tool and what it did. A commit may credit it in a `Co-Authored-By:` or `Assisted-by:` trailer.
- **Run the checks yourself,** and report the results you actually got.
- **Point your agent at [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).** Most coding agents read it on their own, and its rules bind them as they bind you.
- **No autonomous agents.** A person writes or reviews every issue, pull request and comment; an agent may not open them on its own.
- **Check what a tool finds** before you report it, and report security problems privately. An unchecked report is closed.
- **Keep private things out of AI tools:** unpublished security reports, other people's personal data, and any secret.
- Maintainers may close a low-effort generated pull request or issue without a detailed review.

## Our pledge

The maintainers reply to every newcomer's pull request within 7 days, even if only to say when we'll review it.

## Conduct and security

Everyone follows the [code of conduct](https://github.com/djazairdev/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Report security problems privately, as [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/djazairdev/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) says, never in a public issue.

## Licence

The project is released under its [licence](LICENSE). By submitting a contribution, you agree that it's released under the same terms, as section D.6 of [GitHub's Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) provides, and that you have the right to submit it. Don't submit code you didn't write unless its licence allows it to be released under the project's, and say where it came from.
